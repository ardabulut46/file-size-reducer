## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended for development)

#### Step 1: Install Python Requirements
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd file-size-reducer

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Install FFmpeg (Required for video compression)
**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash

### Option 2: Run with Docker (Easiest setup)

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Open your browser to http://localhost:8080
```

## üìã System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **FFmpeg**: Latest version (for video compression)
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum (4GB+ recommended for large files)
- **Storage**: At least 2x the size of your largest file for processing

## üéõÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Upload**: Drag & drop or click to select your image/video file
2. **Adjust Settings**: 
   - **Images**: Set quality (1-100) and resize factor (0.1-1.0)
   - **Videos**: Set CRF value (18-38, lower = better quality)
3. **Compress**: Click the compress button and wait
4. **Download**: Your compressed file downloads automatically

## üîß Customization

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`
- **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.wmv`  
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx` (copied as-is)

### Configuration
Edit `config.py` to modify:
- Maximum file size (default: 10GB)
- Allowed file extensions
- Upload/processed folder locations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "FFmpeg not found" error
- **Solution**: Make sure FFmpeg is installed and in your system PATH

**Problem**: Large videos take forever to process
- **Solution**: This is normal! Video compression is CPU-intensive. Consider using a higher CRF value (28-32) for faster processing.

**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors on file deletion
- **Solution**: Make sure the uploads/ and processed/ folders have write permissions

**Problem**: App crashes with large files
- **Solution**: Increase your system's available RAM or compress smaller files
